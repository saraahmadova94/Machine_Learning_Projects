# Introduction

This project is a data analytics and machine learning study designed to predict **CO2 emissions** from motor vehicles. It aims to analyze the impact of features such as **engine size**, **number of cylinders**, and **fuel consumption** on carbon emissions.

## Project Overview

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Understand the structure of the dataset.
   - Explore relationships between features and CO2 emissions.

2. **Prediction Models:**
   - Use **Simple Linear Regression** and **Multiple Linear Regression** to predict CO2 emissions.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics.
   - Provide insights for potential real-world applications.

This study highlights the role of key vehicle attributes in determining carbon emissions, offering a foundation for more sustainable automotive practices.
